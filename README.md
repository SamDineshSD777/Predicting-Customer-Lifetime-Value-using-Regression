Project : Predicting Customer Lifetime Value using Regression

Project Description: In this project, we will build a predictive model to estimate the customer lifetime value (CLV) based on various features such as customer demographics, purchase history, transaction data, etc. The model will be developed using regression analysis.

Project Objective: The objective of this project is to accurately predict the customer lifetime value (CLV) of individual customers, thereby helping businesses to make data-driven decisions on customer acquisition, retention, and loyalty.

Project Methodology:

1. Data Collection: Collect data on customer demographics, purchase history, transaction data, etc. from various sources, such as customer databases, sales records, etc.

2. Data Cleaning: Clean and preprocess the data to remove any inconsistencies and missing values.

3. Feature Engineering: Create new features from the existing data to improve the performance of the model.

4. Model Selection: Select the appropriate regression algorithms for the predictive model.

5. Model Training: Train the model on the training dataset and tune the hyperparameters for better performance.

6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model on the test dataset using various metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared.
